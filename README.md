# HyperACP
We have deployed the model on www.hyperacp.com. All users can directly access www.hyperacp.com to obtain access and testing permissions for the model.  
Currently, it can be accessed through: http://www.hyperacp.com/model_predict to directly use and test our model.    
## File description  
The ACP_data file contains data.  
The ANBS file contains the ANBS sampling algorithm.  
The final model stores the trained model parameters.  
## Note！！！
The actual number of positive and negative samples for ACP99 is 194 each.   
The annotation in this paper is incorrect, but it has no impact on any of the experiments or results.
